To add your own game:

Create a folder in games
In it create a gameView and whatever else you need. (like a gameEngine, components etc).

Create is a game initializer, and add it to the index.jsx file. That's it!


class gameInitializer:

// This does not need anything specail. Only what you want it to do.
constructor(gameWebSocket) {

// you will probably need this:
this.ws = gameWebSocket;

}

// Return { buttonText, buttonImg, path to}
getMetaInfo() {}


onCreateGame() {
// a host just created a game!
// Create your game object here
// Something like
this.hostGameObject = new myGame();

// add event handlers or whatever you want
}

// Clean up after yourself (this is for someone who created the game)
onHostEndGame() {
// remove event handlers or whatever else you added
}


onJoinGame() {
// setup whatever you need for players to connect to the host.
this.playerGameObject
}
// Clean up needed for non-hose players
onPlayerEndGame() {
// remove event handlers or whatever else you added
}
